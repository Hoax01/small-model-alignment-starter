# Small-Model Alignment Starter

This branch is the student starter package for the SFT + DPO alignment assignment. It is intentionally minimal: it provides the tested environment metadata, assignment PDF, fixed evaluation/data files, and no completed training implementation.

## What Is Included

```text
requirements.txt
pyproject.toml
docs/assignment_manual.pdf
data/persona_lora/ramsay_style_preferences.json
data/persona_lora/README.md
eval_sets/hh_rlhf_eval_300_seed42.json
```

## Recommended Kaggle Setup

Use a Kaggle notebook with the `GPU T4 x2` accelerator. After cloning this repository/branch, run:

```bash
python -m pip uninstall -y -q torchao || true
python -m pip install -q "transformers>=4.43.0,<5" "datasets>=2.18,<5" huggingface_hub accelerate tqdm pyyaml sentencepiece safetensors
python -m pip install -q -e . --no-deps
```

This keeps Kaggle's preinstalled CUDA-compatible PyTorch intact, avoids known stale `torchao` / PEFT conflicts, and makes the local repository importable without replacing the GPU stack.

## What You Need To Build

You will add your own training and evaluation code on top of this starter. At minimum, your project should implement:

- SFT training on 30,000 examples.
- From-scratch DPO on HH-RLHF-style preference data.
- From-scratch DPO on UltraFeedback-style preference data.
- TRL `DPOTrainer` + LoRA training on the provided persona preference data.
- Generation and DPO-vs-SFT evaluation outputs.
- A short final report with plots and analysis.

Read `docs/assignment_manual.pdf` for the full requirements and suggested workflow.

## Fixed Files

- `eval_sets/hh_rlhf_eval_300_seed42.json` is the fixed synthetic helpful/harmless evaluation set.
- For AlpacaEval-style evaluation, use 300 prompts with seed `42` so comparisons are consistent.
- `data/persona_lora/ramsay_style_preferences.json` is the small preference dataset for the LoRA-DPO persona task.

## Saving Work On Kaggle

Kaggle sessions are temporary. Write important outputs under `/kaggle/working`, save notebook versions, and archive checkpoints/generations as zip files or Kaggle output datasets before ending a session.
